## Online English Dictionary

This was the final project of my Web Development course. The goal was to create a website that functions as an Online English Dictionary and integrates all the different technologies and techniques that were covered over the duration of the course: HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, Javascript, Module Pattern, jQuery, AJAX, and JSON.
